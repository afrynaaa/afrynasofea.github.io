<p>I am the first daughter of my parents. My name is Afryna Sofea Binti Affendi. I was born in Klang Selangor on 3rd December 2002. I have 4 siblings which I have one sister and two brothers below me. I am girl who active talking but shy in certain situation, in other word, ambivert. I have been growing up in Shah Alam since I was born. Since I am the eldest among my siblings, leadership has been in me since I was kid.</p>
<p>When I was kindergarten, I was at Real Kids Shah Alam. Then I continued my primary school at SK Padang Jawa. Meanwhile in high school I studied at SMK Seksyen 16 Shah Alam. I took biology when I was Form 4 and 5. After SPM, I decided to take STPM at Kolej Tingkatan Enam Shah Alam for 2 years as I do not want to take risk in pure science anymore. In STPM, I took economics and businesses. Since most people say that sixth form is the hardest, I tried my best to get the best result. I ended my STPM journey with CGPA 3.84 which I never expected.</p> 
<p>I am the type of girl who really likes to take random picture and video and edit it. Since I am a coffee person, I like to try new café to try their coffee and take pictures. Sometimes I will catching sunset if the weather is nice and enjoy the view where sometimes it helps to reduce my stress after had a long day. I also like to share all my pictures that I took in my social media. I also work as a barista, which from there I learn a lot about coffee and how to make latte art. I wish I can get certificate as a barista.</p> 
<p>My hobby is listening to music. I do not have any specific preference for music genre, because I like listen to any random music as long it is good to hear to my ears. But my habit is I like to wear earbuds all the time since I like to hear beat of every music. Personally, I love songs that has piano instrument as it soothes to my ears and give me peace.</p> 
<p>One my dream is I would like to travel around the world. As someone who do not like to stay at home and never say no to tired, I want to travel and enjoy the scenery. My dream country is Australia since it has beautiful city especially Melbourne and “live alone vibes” would be the best to describe about their vibe. I saw a lot of YouTube vlog where many vloggers live there.</p>
<p>I can describe myself as an independent girl since I provide everything to myself using my own money. I do everything on my own and learn not to depend on others since I am not from a silver spoon family. From there I learn a lot of things and gain new experience. But I believe there are more challenges that I need to face in the future. Other than that, I like to make many new friends as I am not that introvert, just shy in certain circumstances. But at the same time, I really like to be alone and doing all things alone as I do not like to wait other people and vice versa. For instance, I will go study alone if I would like to or I will invite a friend to study together if needed.</p> 
<p>Finally, my principle is, if you are not getting what you wish today, you will get in future. All you need is keep patience and pray a lot. But at the same time, you must keep trying and learn something new. I believe that the right time will come to us.</p>
